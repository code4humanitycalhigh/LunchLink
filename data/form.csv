Please add the agua Fresca I tasted at the sample meeting before the school year started. IT WAS SOOOOK GOOOOD! The brunch is good, but have more supply because sometimes it runs out and I want it. The French toast is DELICIOUS. The bagel is a BIG hitter. The Chex cereal is MEH. The rest is ðŸ˜«. Which means Iâ€™m getting kind of tired with it, and so are other people.
